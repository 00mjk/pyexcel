Introduction
-------------

**pyexcel** provides **one** application programming interface to read,
manipulate and write data in different excel formats. This library makes
information processing involving excel files an enjoyable task. The data in
excel files can be turned into :ref:`array or dict<a-list-of-data-structures>`
with least code, vice versa. This library focuses on data
processing using excel files as storage media hence fonts, colors and charts
were not and will not be considered.

{% include "origin.rst.jj2" %}

.. note::

   Since version `0.2.2`, no longer a plugin should be explicitly imported.
   They are imported if they are installed. Please use pip to manage the
   plugins.

Usage
------

.. testcode::
   :hide:

   >>> import pyexcel
   >>> # make sure you had pyexcel-xls pip-installed
   >>> a_list_of_dictionaries = [
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Adam',
   ...         "Age": 28
   ...     },
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Beatrice',
   ...         "Age": 29
   ...     },
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Ceri',
   ...         "Age": 30
   ...     },
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Dean',
   ...         "Age": 26
   ...     }
   ... ]
   >>> pyexcel.save_as(records=a_list_of_dictionaries, dest_file_name="your_file.xls")

Suppose you want to process the following excel data :

========= ====
Name      Age
========= ====
Adam      28
Beatrice  29
Ceri      30
Dean      26
========= ====

Here are the example usages:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import pyexcel as pe
   >>> records = pe.iget_records(file_name="your_file.xls")
   >>> for record in records:
   ...     print("%s is aged at %d" % (record['Name'], record['Age']))
   Adam is aged at 28
   Beatrice is aged at 29
   Ceri is aged at 30
   Dean is aged at 26

.. testcode::
   :hide:

   >>> import os
   >>> os.unlink("your_file.xls")
