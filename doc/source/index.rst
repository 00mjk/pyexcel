Introduction
-------------

**pyexcel** is a wrapper library to read, manipulate and write data in different excel formats: csv, ods, xls, xlsx and xlsm. The data in excel files can be turned into array or dict with least code, and vice versa. And ready-made or custom filters and formatters can be applied. But it does not support fonts, colors and charts.

It was created due to the lack of uniform programming interface to access data in different excel formats. A developer needs to use different methods of different libraries to read the same data in different excel formats, hence the resulting code is cluttered and unmaintainable.

In addition, the library recognizes that Excel files are de-facto file format for information sharing in non-software centric organisations. Excel files are not only used for mathematical computation in financial institutions but also used for many othe purposes in an office work environment.

All great work have done by odf, xlrd and other individual developers. This library unites only the data access code.
