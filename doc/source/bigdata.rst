Work with big data sheet
================================================================================

When you are dealing with huge amount of data, obviously you would not like to
fill up your memory with those data. Here is a the feature to support pagination
of your data.

.. testcode::
   :hide:

    >>> import sys
    >>> if sys.version_info[0] < 3:
    ...     from StringIO import StringIO
    ... else:
    ...     from io import StringIO
    >>> from pyexcel_io._compact import OrderedDict

Let's assume the following file is a huge csv file:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import datetime
   >>> import pyexcel as pe
   >>> data = [
   ...     [1, 21, 31],
   ...     [2, 22, 32],
   ...     [3, 23, 33],
   ...     [4, 24, 34],
   ...     [5, 25, 35],
   ...     [6, 26, 36]
   ... ]
   >>> pe.save_as(array=data, dest_file_name="your_file.csv")

And let's pretend to read partial data:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> pe.get_sheet(file_name="your_file.csv", start_row=2, row_limit=3)
   your_file.csv:
   +---+----+----+
   | 3 | 23 | 33 |
   +---+----+----+
   | 4 | 24 | 34 |
   +---+----+----+
   | 5 | 25 | 35 |
   +---+----+----+

And you could as well do the same for columns:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> pe.get_sheet(file_name="your_file.csv", start_column=1, column_limit=2)
   your_file.csv:
   +----+----+
   | 21 | 31 |
   +----+----+
   | 22 | 32 |
   +----+----+
   | 23 | 33 |
   +----+----+
   | 24 | 34 |
   +----+----+
   | 25 | 35 |
   +----+----+
   | 26 | 36 |
   +----+----+

Obvious, you could do both at the same time:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> pe.get_sheet(file_name="your_file.csv",
   ...     start_row=2, row_limit=3)
   ...     start_column=1, column_limit=2)
   your_file.csv:
   +---+----+----+
   | 3 | 23 | 33 |
   +---+----+----+
   | 4 | 24 | 34 |
   +---+----+----+
   | 5 | 25 | 35 |
   +---+----+----+


The pagination support is available across all pyexcel plugins.

.. note::

   No column pagination support for query sets as data source.
